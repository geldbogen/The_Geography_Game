In the republican era, all military death sentences imposed for crimes committed during wartime (the Second World War was Brazil's last international military conflict) were similarly commuted and not carried out. The current Constitution of Brazil (1988) expressly forbids the use of capital punishment, except for military offences committed during a war duly declared by Congress.[156] The last person to suffer the death penalty in Brazil was executed in 1876, during the Imperial era. After 1876, Emperor Pedro II adopted in practice an abolitionist policy through his prerogative of Mercy as Head of State, by directing that all death sentences be submitted by the Courts to the Imperial Government for examination regarding commutation (even without a request for pardon or commutation from the person condemned), and by granting commutations for all death sentences that were passed.

On 5 January 2012, ""a large majority of MPs"" adopted a bill that aims to abolish the death penalty. After two years under the official moratorium, the State Great Khural formally signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.[247] This makes Mongolia abolitionist because under Article 1, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Covenant, ・E・ENo one within the jurisdiction of a State Party to the present Protocol shall be executed,・E・E and ・E・EEach State Party shall take all necessary measures to "
Myanmar,1988.0,"Death penalty for murder, terrorism, participating in a gang robbery if one of the robbers commits murder, abetting a successful mutiny, assault by a person under a life sentence which causing harm, assault with the intention to murder which causing only harm, perjury causing wrongful execution,[251] high treason[252] and drug trafficking.[253]Myanmar has not carried out executions since 1988.[254][255] While Myanmar courts do hand down death sentences pro forma in particularly egregious cases, most recently in the 2018 case of Myo Zaw Oo who was convicted of the rape and murder of a government worker,[256] the sentences in practice are not carried out and are in effect life sentences. There have been three major amnesties (1989, 1993, 1997) in which the government commuted death sentences to life sentences or less, and simultaneously reduced life sentences to 10 years. However, prisoners held for political crimes, or crimes against the state are typically excluded from such amnesties.[255] Nevertheless, Myanmar is regarded as ""abolitionist in practice"" by both Amnesty International[257] and Death Penalty Watch.[254]
The country's abolitionist-in-practice status is currently in jeopardy as on 1 February 2021 the military overthrew the democratic government in a coup. On 14 March, the military declared martial law in selected regions of two largest cities (Yangon and Mandalay) and furthermore announced the introduction of a suite of new laws and penalties for insurrection and protest, including capital punishment.[258] On 9 April 2021 state broadcaster Myawaddy TV announced that 23 protesters had been charged with murder, and pursuant to s496 of the criminal code, would face execution. The date of the execution was not announced, and it currently (as of 10 April) is unknown whether or how the sentences will be carried out. At least 17 of the convicted were tried in absentia[259] and it is unclear whether they have since been apprehended.
While this would put Myanmar in the ""retentionist"" category, the sentences have yet to be carried out. Furthermore, the legitimacy of the military government and the recently imposed martial laws are contested by the deposed government (known as the NUG) who claim sole legislative authority. The international community thus far have not decided whether the military junta or NUG is the legitimate government, and as such it is not clear whether these proposed executions would be seen by the international community as lawful applications of the death penalty, or extrajudicial killings carried out by armed forces.
In addition, executions are carried out within the de facto autonomous Wa State. Wa state (officially the Wa Self-Administered Division) is nominally a semi-autonomous division located in two disconnected regions within Shan State. As such it is in principle subject to the laws, enforcement, and judicial system of Myanmar. However, in reality, the Wa State is controlled entirely by the United Wa State Army (UWSA) - an ethnic armed organisation (EAO) previously in open rebellion against the Myanmar government and military. While in recent years the UWSA has reached a dﾃｩtente with the Myanmar central authority, the Myanmar legal system does not apply in practice within Wa State. To wit, death sentences are handed down and carried out regularly, most recently in 2020.[260] Wa State imposes the death penalty only for murder [261] and executions are carried out by gunshot to the back of the head.
An other de facto autonomous region, Mong La (officially: Shan State Special region 4) on the Myanmar-Chinese border under the control of the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) is also reputed to carry out executions much like Wa State,[262] however information is less reliable as executions are not officially announced."
