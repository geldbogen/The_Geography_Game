The airport often struggles to accommodate all flights at its current limit of 81 aircraft movements per hour. Although over capacity, a 2012 ACI survey declared that the airport is being operated safely. The two original runways suffer from pavement and strength issues, which limited the airport's capacity to serve large aircraft. To reduce congestion and to achieve a target to handle 100 flights per hour, a third runway opened in August 2019. Upgrades of the original two runways for safety and to accommodate wide-bodied aircraft are almost complete. The airport will be able to serve 100 million passengers annually by 2025 after completion of ongoing development work.

It is located in Ōta, Tokyo, 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) south of Tokyo Station.
Haneda was the primary international airport serving Tokyo until 1978; from 1978 to 2010, Haneda handled almost all domestic flights to and from Tokyo as well as ""scheduled charter"" flights to a small number of major cities in East and Southeast Asia, while Narita International Airport handled the vast majority of international flights from further locations. In 2010, a dedicated international terminal, currently Terminal 3, was opened at Haneda in conjunction with the completion of a fourth runway, allowing long-haul flights during night-time hours. Haneda opened up to long-haul service during the daytime in March 2014, with carriers offering nonstop service to 25 cities in 17 countries.The Japanese government encourages the use of Haneda for premium business routes and the use of Narita for leisure routes and by low-cost carriers.  However, the major full-service carriers may have a choice to fly to both airports. Haneda handled 87,098,683 passengers in 2018; by passenger throughput, it was the third-busiest airport in Asia and the fourth-busiest in the world, after Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Beijing Capital International Airport (Asia's busiest), and Dubai International Airport. It is able to handle 90 million passengers per year following its expansion in 2018. With Haneda and Narita combined, Tokyo has the third-busiest city airport system in the world, after London and New York.
In 2020, Haneda was named the second best airport after Singapore's Changi Airport and the World's Best Domestic Airport. As of 2021, Haneda was rated by Skytrax as the second Best Airport in-between Qatar's Hamad International Airport and Singapore's Changi Airport, and maintaining its best Domestic Airport title from the previous year.
