Rejected by his mother at birth, he was raised by zookeepers.  He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than 30 years.  At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a tourist attraction and commercial success. After the German tabloid newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that decried keeping the cub in captivity, fans worldwide rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans. Children protested outside the zoo, and e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub's life were sent from around the world.
Knut became the center of a mass media phenomenon dubbed ""Knutmania"" that spanned the globe and spawned toys, media specials, DVDs, and books.  Because of this, the cub was largely responsible for a significant increase in revenue, estimated at €5 million, at the Berlin Zoo in 2007.  Attendance figures for the year increased by an estimated 30 percent, making it the most profitable year in its 163-year history.On 19 March 2011, Knut unexpectedly died at the age of four.

In August 2018, at age 15, she started spending her Fridays outside the Swedish Parliament to call for stronger action on climate change by holding up a sign reading Skolstrejk för klimatet (School Strike for Climate). Thunberg initially gained notice for her youth and her straightforward and blunt speaking manner, both in public and to political leaders and assemblies, in which she criticizes world leaders for their failure to take what she considers sufficient action to address the climate crisis.Soon, other students engaged in similar protests in their own communities. Together, they organized a school climate strike movement under the name Fridays for Future. After Thunberg addressed the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference, student strikes took place every week all around the world. In 2019, there were multiple coordinated multi-city protests involving over a million students each. To avoid carbon-intensive flying, Thunberg sailed on a yacht to North America, where she attended the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit. Her speech there, in which she exclaimed ""How dare you?"", was widely taken up by the press and incorporated into music. She speaks fluent English, and most of her public interactions are in English.
Her sudden rise to world fame made her both a leader in the activist community and a target for critics, especially due to her youth. Her influence on the world stage has been described by The Guardian and other newspapers as the ""Greta effect"". She received numerous honours and awards, including an honorary Fellowship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, inclusion in Time's 100 most influential people, being the youngest Time Person of the Year, inclusion in the Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women (2019), and nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg
