He approached his aesthetic from a different perspective by helping women find confidence by looking both comfortable and elegant at the same time. He is also credited with having introduced the ""Le Smoking"" tuxedo suit for women and was known for his use of non-European cultural references and of diverse models.

In her youth Jessica was very interested in sport and traveling and her mother worried that she was a bit too 'tomboyish' and not 'girly' enough.  At about 16 years of age her mother enrolled her into modelling classes, which Jessica found she enjoyed. As a result, Jessica went on to participate in numerous fashion competitions in Europe the US and Mexico as well as having succeeded in many beauty competitions.

The founder and namesake of the Chanel brand, she was credited in the post-World War I era with popularizing a sporty, casual chic as the feminine standard of style. This replaced the ""corseted silhouette"" that was dominant beforehand with a style that was simpler, far less time consuming to put on and remove, more comfortable, and less expensive, all without sacrificing elegance. She is the only fashion designer listed on Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. A prolific fashion creator, Chanel extended her influence beyond couture clothing, realizing her aesthetic design in jewellery, handbags, and fragrance. Her signature scent, Chanel No. 5, has become an iconic product, and Chanel herself designed her famed interlocked-CC monogram, which has been in use since the 1920s.During the German occupation of France during World War II, Chanel was criticized for being too close to the German occupiers to boost her professional career; one of Chanel's liaisons was with a German diplomat, Baron (Freiherr) Hans Günther von Dincklage. After the war, Chanel was interrogated about her relationship with von Dincklage, but she was not charged as a collaborator due to intervention by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. After several post-war years in Switzerland, she returned to Paris and revived her fashion house. In 2011, Hal Vaughan published a book about Chanel based on newly declassified documents, revealing that she had collaborated directly with the Nazi intelligence service, the Sicherheitsdienst. One plan in late 1943 was for her to carry an SS peace overture to Churchill to end the war.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Chanel

Singapore,7,Bonny Hicks,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4942499,wd:Q4942499,2540469,Singaporean model,"Bonny Susan Hicks (5 January 1968 – 19 December 1997) was a Singaporean model and writer. After garnering local fame as a model, she gained worldwide recognition for her contributions to Singaporean post-colonial literature and the anthropic philosophy conveyed in her works. Her first book, Excuse Me, Are You A Model?, is recognised as a significant milestone in the literary and cultural history of Singapore. Hicks later published a second book, Discuss Disgust, and many shorter pieces in press outlets, including a short-lived opinion column in a major Singaporean daily that was pulled due to public dissent from Singaporean traditionalists.
Hicks died at age 29 on 19 December 1997 aboard SilkAir Flight 185 when it crashed into the Musi River on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The U.S.'s National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) expressed high confidence that the crash was an act of suicide and mass murder by the troubled Singaporean pilot, a colleague of Hicks' ex-husband. All 104 passengers and all crew perished.
After Hicks' death, numerous publications including the book Heaven Can Wait: Conversations with Bonny Hicks by Tal Ben-Shahar featured her life and thought. Although she was deemed controversial by many during her lifetime because of her willingness to openly discuss human sexuality, Singaporean literary scholars today deem Hicks' voice as a pivotally important one for interpreting contemporary Singaporean society.
Hicks' legacy today is one of an important transitional social figure between old and new Singapore during its period of broad-scale societal changes under the forces of globalisation. Her death resulted in the loss of a Singaporean national voice that was both growing and important yet internally conflicted while confrontive. Criticisms by Singaporean traditionalists during her modelling and authoring careers continually vexed Hicks' conscience and drove her to re-evaluate her life. Hicks ultimately made a sustained series of traditionalist choices during the latter years of her life.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonny_Hicks
