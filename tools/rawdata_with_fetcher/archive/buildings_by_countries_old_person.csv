He was a nephew of Francisco Vázquez de Coronado y Luján, who explored the southwestern United States between 1540 and 1542.
By a decree given at Aranjuez by King Philip II of Spain on 8 April 1565, Juan Vásquez de Coronado was appointed as the first royal governor and first Adelantado (a hereditary title) of the province of Costa Rica, but his ship disappeared in a storm off the coast of southern Spain while he was on his way to receive his appointments from the monarch.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of March-July 43 with Lucius Pedanius Secundus as his colleague.An inscription from Pietas Julia in Istria, erected by one Gaius Precius Felix Napolitanus, provides us many details of his cursus honorum, although not in chronological order. Hister began his career as one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that form the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. His next documented office was military tribune of Legio XIV Gemina, at the time stationed in Germania Superior at Moguntiacum. Of the traditional Republican magistracies, only plebeian tribune and praetor are recorded in this inscription, but one can assume he held the first in this series of offices, quaestor. The inscription also attests he was a legatus (which could mean he was a governor of an imperial province or a commander of a Roman legion) and governor of a public province. While Histor was a praetor, he also achieved the honor of being a comites or companion of the emperor Claudius.
One office Histor held not recorded in the Istrian inscription was governor of the imperial province of Pannonia; Tacitus is our source for this fact. While the translation of Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb call this governor ""P. Atellius Hister"", editions of Tacitus more recent than that used by Church and Brodribb call him ""Palpellius Hister"". Further, P. Atellius Hister is not otherwise attested. Tacitus attests Palpellius Hister held this post in the year 50, when Vannius, king of the Quadi, was driven from his throne and kingdom by Vibilius, king of the Hermunduri, and two sons of Vannius' sister, Vangio and Sido. Although the emperor Claudius declined to intervene in this conflict, he gave orders to Hister to have his legions and some picked Auxiliaries encamped on the banks of the Danube ""as a support to the conquered and a terror to the conqueror, who might otherwise, in the elation of success, disturb the peace of our empire.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Palpellius_Hister

Joaquín de San Martín was a lieutenant of dragoons in Yoro and an official in the governments of Tegucigalpa and Nacaome. In 1819 he moved permanently to El Salvador, with his wife Joaquina Fugón. He was elected deputy from Tejutla and Chalatenango, where he held extensive rural properties, in 1824.
He joined the Salvadoran army, and was promoted to colonel. He was magistrate of the Court of Justice from December 24, 1824 to March 1, 1830. By vote of the towns he was elected vice-chief of state under Mariano Prado in 1832, and from May 13, 1832 to July 25, 1834 he exercised the functions of chief of state. He left office on the latter date when Prado returned to power. Prado served until July 1, 1833, when San Martín again became president. His second term continued until June 23, 1834.
During his administration, he suppressed the Nonualco Indigenous revolt led by Anastasio Aquino. He also dealt with several military revolts. With the aid of Captain Ramón Belloso and his company, San Martín also suppressed the hordes of thieves dominating the country, many of whom had tried to join with Aquino to contest governmental authority. On February 13, 1833, San Martín decreed an amnesty for the rebel Nonualco Indians.
In March 1833, General Francisco Morazán joined with rebel forces against San Martín. On April 6, 1833 San Martín and Morazán signed an agreement reconciling their differences.
On July 1, 1833 the Congress of the state reorganized the Salvadoran government, making San Martín chief of state for a second time, and Lorenzo González vice chief of state. This election was annulled by the federal Congress. Nevertheless, his second term continued until June 23, 1834. On that date, General Carlos Salazar, imposed by Morazán, took over the government.
González was assassinated in his hacienda La Asunción in May 1834. San Martín was condemned to two years of exile and the confiscation of his property. On his return to the country he was deputy to the constituent congress of the state, from 1840 to 1841, and afterwards vice president.
Colonel San Martín distinguished himself as a defender of the law during the tragic days of September 1841, when General Francisco Malespín staged a coup d'état and overthrew the legal president, Antonio José Cañas.
San Martín died in 1854 at the age of 84 at his hacienda Amayo. His son José María San Martín was president of independent El Salvador in 1852 and again in 1854-56.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_de_San_Mart%C3%ADn

Géza returned with Polish reinforcements and signed a treaty with Solomon in early 1064.

Géza closely cooperated with Solomon, but their relationship became tense from 1071. The king invaded the duchy in February 1074 and defeated Géza in a battle. However, Géza was victorious at the decisive battle of Mogyoród on 14 March 1074.

He was the son of Thorstein the Red, jarl of Caithness, and his wife Thurid Eyvindsdottir. The byname ""feilan"" is derived from the Old Irish fáelán, meaning wolfling or little wolf.
After the death of his father Olaf was reared by his grandmother Aud the Deep-minded, and emigrated with her to Iceland, where they settled at the estate called Hvamm in the Laxardal region. Olaf married a woman named Alfdis of Barra, around 920. According to the Laxdæla saga Aud (called ""Unn"" in the saga) held Olaf dearer than anyone else, and bequested the Hvamm estate to him after her death. She arranged Olaf's betrothal to Alfdis, and planned the wedding feast for the end of summer (or autumn), which she predicted ""would be the last feast I would hold"". She indeed died during the festivities that lasted 3-days, but the feast was continued to commemorate both Olaf's marriage and Aud's death. The Landnámabók gives briefer notice on this, merely stating she died during the funeral feast she held for herself in anticipation of her own death.The children of Olaf and Alfdis were Thord Gellir, Thora, Helga, Thorunn, and Thordis.

A historical connection from this soldier to Jesus has long been hypothesized by numerous scholars, based on the claim of the ancient Greek philosopher Celsus, who, according to Christian writer Origen in his ""Against Celsus""  (Greek Κατὰ Κέλσου, Kata Kelsou; Latin Contra Celsum), was the author of a work entitled The True Word (Greek Λόγος Ἀληθής, Logos Alēthēs).
Celsus' work was lost, but in Origen's account of it Jesus was depicted as the result of an affair between his mother Mary and a Roman soldier. He said she was ""convicted of adultery and had a child by a certain soldier named Panthera"". According to James Tabor, Tiberius Pantera could have been serving in the region at the time of Jesus's conception. Both the ancient Talmud and medieval Jewish writings and sayings reinforced this notion, referring to ""Yeshu ben Pantera"", which translates as ""Jesus, son of Pantera"". Tabor's hypothesis is considered highly unlikely by mainstream scholars given that there is little other evidence to support Pantera's paternity outside of the Greek and Jewish texts.Historically, the name Pantera is not unusual and was in use among Roman soldiers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Julius_Abdes_Pantera

Unlike many Mongol leaders who were willing to massacre to gain any advantage, Muqali usually attempted to convert foes into friends by more conciliatory means.By the time of Ogedei's reign (1229-1241), he was viewed as the best of the extraordinarily talented pool of Mongol generals.

He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being, who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. He taught for around 45 years and built a large following, both monastic and lay. His teaching is based on his insight into the arising of suffering or dissatisfaction and its ending—the state called Nirvana (lit. vanishing or extinguishing).
The Buddha was born into an aristocratic family in the Shakya clan, but eventually renounced lay life. According to Buddhist tradition, after several years of mendicancy, meditation, and asceticism, he awakened to understand the workings of the cycle of rebirth and how it can be escaped. The Buddha then traveled throughout the Gangetic plain teaching and building a religious community. The Buddha taught a middle way between sensual indulgence and the severe asceticism found in the Indian śramaṇa movement. He taught a training of the mind that included ethical training, self-restraint, and meditative practices such as jhana and mindfulness. The Buddha also critiqued the practices of Brahmin priests, such as animal sacrifice and the caste system.A couple of centuries after his death he came to be known by the title Buddha, which means ""Awakened One"" or ""Enlightened One"". Gautama's teachings were compiled by the Buddhist community in the Vinaya, his codes for monastic practice, and the Suttas, texts based on his discourses. These were passed down in Middle Indo-Aryan dialects through an oral tradition. Later generations composed additional texts, such as systematic treatises known as Abhidharma, biographies of the Buddha, collections of stories about the Buddha's past lives known as Jataka tales, and additional discourses, i.e. the Mahayana sutras. Due to his influence on Indian religions, in Vaishnavism he came to be regarded as the 9th avatar of Vishnu.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha

Sunni conducted a repressive policy against the scholars of Timbuktu, especially those of the Sankore region who were associated with the Tuareg whom Ali expelled to gain control of the town.
Sunni Ali organized a fleet to the Niger river. During his reign, Songhai surpassed the height of the Mali Empire, engulfing areas under the Mali Empire (and the Ghana Empire before it). His death, on November 6, 1492, is a matter of conjecture. According to the Tarikh al-Sudan, Ali drowned while crossing the Niger River. Oral tradition believes he was killed by his sister's son, Askia Muhammad Ture. He was succeeded by his son, Sunni Baru, who was challenged by Askia because Baru was not seen as a faithful Muslim. Askia succeeded to the throne.

When they reached Medina, they entered Masjid al-Nabawi while he was addressing his congregation. Zayd and his delegation were astonished by the attention of the Muslims and the effect of his words on them. Muhammad said:
""I am better for you than al-Uzza (one of the main idols of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic era) and everything else that you worship. I am better for you than the black camel which you worship besides God.""

""From now on you are Zayd al-Khayr (""Zayd the good"") instead, not Zayd al-Khayl,"" said Muhammad.
Muhammad said about him, ""Of every Arab's virtues I heard, after meeting him, I found it overestimated - except Zaid whom I found more than I had heard about him (in virtues)""During this visit in Medina all those who stayed with Zayd became Muslims.However, there was an epidemic of fever in Medina and Zayd al-Khayr succumbed to it.

Gahindiro deployed a large number of troops, but it began mainly during the reign of Cyilima II, when they set up camps due to the fact that at that time Burundi was waging a major war against Rwanda seeking to overthrow the Bicura. of Rwaka who had taken refuge there and Rugira. Gahindiro changed the culture so that the units of the previous dynasties were not as old as the other dynasties, but were instead run by the courts or parishes. As members of the armed forces aged, they were replaced by their sons. Each camp was a large house made up of warriors and their servants or war companions. It consisted of at least two heads, one made up of 120 combatants.

He is best known for his works on the flora and fauna of St Vincent in particular and on the Caribbean in general. He wrote numerous illustrated papers for journals of scholarly societies in England including the first descriptions of velvet worms and scale insects in the ground pearl family.

Guilding was born on 9 May 1797 in Kingstown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. He was one of six siblings, son of the Reverend John Guilding and his wife Sarah. In 1802, at the age of 5, he was sent to England, where he studied at Oxford University. In 1817, after receiving a B.A. degree, he returned to his home country. His father died in 1818, and he took up work as garrison chaplain and left for England in 1819. In 1821, Guilding travelled to England to marry Mary Hunt, daughter of the Rev. S. Hunt, rector of Wakerly and St. George's Church, Stamford. From 1824 to 1826 he disputed with Robert Herries for the right to payment for paupers' funerals. Herries claimed that Guilding had expunged the minutes of some meetings to change the vote of a vestry election, causing Herries to lose his position. Guilding stated that it was ""just a misunderstanding”.In 1818, Guilding was accepted as Fellow of the Linnean Society, and by 1820 he was corresponding with Joseph Dalton Hooker, Aylmer Bourke Lambert and other established scientists. Hooker wrote that Guilding was ""an arrogant, demanding, ambitious, and often conceited individual, all too ready to ask for unusual favors"". His first zoological paper was read at the Linnean Society and published in 1822. Guilding was a capable artist of plant and animal drawings. He prided himself on the accuracy of his work and his use of color. When his work was redrawn he criticized both the artist and the engraver. His book “An Account of the Botanic Gardens of the Island of St. Vincent” was published in Glasgow in 1825. Guilding was an excellent artist and engraver and he produced a ""Table of Colours Arranged for Naturalists"" in 1825 which may have been the first biological colour chart. This production was submitted to the Wernerian Natural History Society, where it was presented by the president, Professor Robert Jameson. He corresponded with Charles Darwin, providing him with notes on the natural history of the Caribbean region.In 1826, Guilding published the first description of a member of the phylum Onychophora. He found what he thought was an unusual type of slug, and included it along with his Caribbean mollusks. He named this genus Peripatus (1826). He included an excellent watercolor painting of the specimen, and a mention to the defensive mechanism of sticky liquid squirts. A translation into English from Guilding's description, originally written in Latin, shows how he first classified the specimen in the Class Moluska, and how astonished he was for discovering a new species.He was also among the first to describe scale insects of the ground pearl family, Margarodidae. Guilding's announced ""Fauna"" and ""Pomona occidentalis"" were never completed. The manuscripts were lost, together with his table of colors.
Guilding's first wife died ""in childbed” on 15 November 1827, leaving five children behind. A year later he married Charlotte Lydia Melville, of St. George's, Grenada. In 1831 he went on vacation to Bermuda, where he died on 22 October. The cause of death was not recorded.

He was responsible for the construction of some of the most notable buildings in history, including the original Pantheon, and is well known for his important military victories, notably the Battle of Actium in 31 BC against the forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra. 
Born to a plebeian family of equestrian rank in 63 BC, in an uncertain location in Roman Italy, he met the future emperor Augustus, then known as Octavian, at Apollonia, in Illyria. Following the assassination of Octavian's great-uncle Julius Caesar in 44 BC, Octavian returned to Italy. Around this time, he was elected tribune of the plebs. Agrippa served as a military commander, fighting alongside Octavian and Caesar's former general and right-hand man Mark Antony in the Battle of Philippi. In 40 BC, he became the Praetor Urbanus (Urban Prefect) of Rome, managing the administration of the city. He played a major role in the Second Triumvirate's war against Lucius Antonius and Fulvia, respectively the brother and wife of Mark Antony. In 39 or 38 BC, Agrippa was appointed governor of Transalpine Gaul. In 38 BC he put down a rising of the Aquitanians and fought the Germanic tribes. He was consul for 37 BC, well below the usual minimum age of 43, to oversee the preparations for warfare against Sextus Pompey, who had cut off grain shipments to Rome.
Agrippa defeated Pompey in the battles of Mylae and Naulochus in 36 BC. In 33 BC, he served as Curule aedile. Agrippa commanded the victorious Octavian's fleet at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Following the victory at Actium, Octavian became emperor, and took the title of Augustus, while Agrippa remained as his close friend and lieutenant. Agrippa assisted Augustus in making Rome ""a city of marble."" Agrippa renovated aqueducts to provide Roman citizens from every social class access to the highest quality public services, and was responsible for the creation of many baths, porticoes, and gardens. He was also awarded powers almost as great as those of Augustus. He had veto power over the acts of the Senate and the power to present laws for approval by the People. He died in 12 BC at the age of 50–51. Augustus honored his memory with a magnificent funeral and spent over a month in mourning. His remains were placed in Augustus' own mausoleum.
Agrippa was also known as a writer, especially on geography. Under his supervision, Julius Caesar's design of having a complete survey of the empire made was accomplished. From the materials at hand he constructed a circular chart, which was engraved on marble by Augustus and afterwards placed in the colonnade built by his sister Vipsania Polla.

1689,State of Palestine,-1,Jesus,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q302,wd:Q302,1095706,"Jewish preacher and religious leader, central figure of Christianity","Jesus (c. 4 BC –  AD 30 / 33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader. He is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited messiah (the Christ), prophesied in the Hebrew Bible.
Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically. The quest for the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the New Testament reflects the historical Jesus, as the only records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels. Jesus was a Galilean Jew, who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry. His teachings were initially conserved by oral transmission and he himself was often referred to as ""rabbi"". Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Jerusalem. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Church.Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Commonly, Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity. A small minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on December 25 as Christmas. His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. The world's most widely used calendar era—in which the current year is 2022 AD/CE—is based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus.Jesus is also revered in other religions. In Islam, Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name ʿĪsā) is considered the penultimate prophet of God and the messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin, but was neither God nor a son of God. The Quran states that Jesus never claimed to be divine. Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified, but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.

His name is derived from that of his birthplace, Damascus. He was born around 64 BC. Nicolaus is known to have had a brother named Ptolemy, who served in the court of Herod as a type of book-keeper or accountant.
He was an intimate friend of Herod the Great, whom he survived by a number of years.  He was also the tutor of the children of Mark Antony and Cleopatra (born in c.68 BC), according to Sophronius. He went to Rome with Herod Archelaus, to defend the young man's claim to the throne upon the death of his father Herod the Great.Given that Book 4 of his History was on Abraham, Nicolaus was most likely a Jew, though one who had been thoroughly Hellenised. As such, he may well have known his contemporary Philo of Alexandria. Since Nicolaus wrote a work On the Psyche, he may well have been, like Philo, in the school of the Pythagoreans or Platonists and been part of the syncretisation of Judaic monotheism with the monotheism (the Monad/The Good) of those two schools.
His output was vast, but is nearly all lost. His chief work was a universal history in 144 books. He also wrote an autobiography, a life of Augustus, a life of Herod, some philosophical works, and some tragedies and comedies.
There is an article on him in the Suda.

1783,Tunisia,-98,Cassius Dionysius,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q730789,wd:Q730789,7400240,ancient Greek agricultural writer of the 2nd century BC.,"Cassius Dionysius of Utica (Ancient Greek: Διονύσιος ὁ Ἰτυκαῖος) was an ancient Greek agricultural writer of the 2nd century BC. The Roman nomen, Cassius, combined with the Greek cognomen, Dionysius, make it likely that he was a slave (perhaps a prisoner of war), originally Greek-speaking, who was owned and afterwards freed by a Roman of the gens Cassia. Cassius Dionysius compiled a farming manual in Greek, now lost. Its title was Georgika (""Agriculture""); it was divided into twenty books, and was dedicated by its author to the Roman praetor Sextilius.
According to Columella, who referred to the work in his own surviving De Agricultura (""On Farming""), an amount equivalent to eight books of Cassius Dionysius' work, two-fifths of the whole, was translated from a preceding work in Punic by Mago. After Rome's destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, the Carthaginian libraries were given to the kings of Numidia, but Mago's work was considered too important to lose. It was brought to Rome and Decimus Junius Silanus was commissioned by the Roman Senate to translate it into Latin. Whether Cassius Dionysius worked independently, or on the basis of Silanus's work, is not known; however, his residence in Utica, in formerly Carthaginian north Africa, leads to the suggestion that he knew Punic as well as Greek and Latin.
Cassius Dionysius's compilation is occasionally cited by later authors, but its length rendered it unpopular. It was soon afterwards abridged by Diophanes of Nicaea, whose version was divided into six books.The following is a partial list of fragments of Cassius Dionysius' work:

Greek names of the winds and their importance to the farmer.
How to select labourers for hire.

Mules sometimes foal in Africa. Mules and mares foal in the twelfth month after conception.

His younger siblings were Polemon II of Pontus, who would succeed his mother and became the last ruler of Pontus, and Antonia Tryphaena who was the Queen of Thrace.

His paternal grandfather was Zenon, a prominent orator and aristocrat, who was an ally to Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. His maternal grandparents were Pythodoros of Tralles and Antonia.

In 18 AD, the previous Armenian King, Vonones I, was exiled and Artaxias was a popular choice with the Armenians to replace him. Roman general Germanicus, with the approval of the Roman emperor Tiberius, agreed that Artaxias be crowned as the new Roman client king of Armenia.
The Armenians paid homage to him and acclaimed him as King Artaxias. He was named after the city of Artaxata in which he was proclaimed king.  Artaxias reigned until his death in 34 AD.

Born and raised in Amsterdam, he studied in Bruges, where he passed a degree in painting at the University of Groningen. He then went to Périgueux, where he became a rich customer of the Portrait Painter, Count Bosquet's, school.
He was introduced to Columbus by a fellow student, Count Didier d'Ailly, who arranged for him to be displayed on the mausoleum at Castile. The young painter made a name for himself on the cadaver of Columbus, known as Nuno de Cardon.
Around the year 1500 Francisco Henriques came to Portugal from Bruges, where he may have been a disciple of Gerard David. It is thought that his first work in Portugal was the main altarpiece of Viseu Cathedral (1501–1506, now in the Grão Vasco Museum in Viseu), leading a workshop that included Portuguese painter Vasco Fernandes, then in the beginning of his career. Among his influences was the early Dutch engraver Master I. A.

His name was previously reconstructed as Tincommius, based on abbreviated coin legends and a damaged mention in Augustus's Res Gestae, but since 1996 coins have been discovered which give his full name.
He was the son and heir of Commius and succeeded his father around 25-20 BC. Based on coin distribution it is possible that Tincomarus ruled in collaboration with his father for the last few years of Commius's life. Little is known of his reign although numismatic evidence suggests that he was more sympathetic to Rome than his father was in later years: the coins he issued  much more closely resemble Roman types, and are made in such a way they may have come from Roman die-cutters. GC Boon has suggested that this technical advance was not limited to coinage and represents wider industrial assistance from the Roman Empire. Tincomarus's successors used the term rex on their coins and this indicates that Tincomarus had begun the process of achieving client kingdom status with Rome (see Roman client kingdoms in Britain).
John Creighton argues, based on the imagery used on his coins, that Tincomarus may have been brought up as an obses (diplomatic hostage) in Rome in the early years of Augustus's reign. He compares Tincomarus's coins to those of Juba II of Numidia, who is known to have been an obses, and identifies a coin found in Numidia which may bear the name of Tincomarus's younger brother Verica.
By 16 BC Roman pottery and other imports appear in considerable quantities at Tincomarus's capital of Calleva Atrebatum, today known as Silchester, and it is likely that the Atrebatic king had established trading and diplomatic links with Augustus.
Tincomarus was expelled by his subjects for unknown reasons around AD 8 and fled to Rome as a refugee and supplicant. He was replaced by his brother Eppillus whom Augustus chose to recognise as rex rather than depose and reinstate Tincomarus. Augustus may have planned to use his ally's ejection as an excuse to invade Britain but other, more pressing foreign policy matters probably persuaded him to postpone the move.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tincomarus
