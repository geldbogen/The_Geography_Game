# The_Geography_Game
## Introduction
Welcome to the Geography-Game :earth_africa:

This is a Risk-inspired (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) digital board game, based on real-world data. 

As in the game Risk, you want to expand your empire as much as possible and claim as many countries as possible.

The game is for any amount of players (although 2-4 are recommended) and a usual round takes around one hour to complete.

## Basic Rules
The game is (as any normal board game) played in turns. 
Assume we play with three players A ðŸ”´ ,B ðŸ”µ, and C ðŸŸ¢.
After starting the game and choosing a color for each player the interface looks like this:

Hold the right mouse button, and drag the screen to scroll around.

The lower part of the screen tells you, whose turn it is, and which country (if any) they have already selected.

Click on a country with the left mouse button, to select it.
For example after A ðŸ”´ clicked on the United States, you can see the following:
