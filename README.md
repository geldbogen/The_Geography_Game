# The_Geography_Game
## Introduction
Welcome to the Geography-Game :earth_africa:

This is a Risk-inspired (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) digital board game, powered by real-world data. 

As in the game Risk, you want to expand your empire as much as possible and claim as many countries as possible.

The game is for any amount of players (although 2-4 are recommended) and a usual round takes around one hour to complete.

## Basic Rules
The game is (as any normal board game) played in turns. 
Assume we play with three players A ðŸ”´ ,B ðŸ”µ, and C ðŸŸ¢.
After starting the game and choosing a color for each player the interface looks like this:

Hold the right mouse button, and drag the screen to scroll around.

The lower part of the screen tells you, whose turn it is, and which country (if any) they have already selected.

Click on a country with the left mouse button, to select it.
For example after A ðŸ”´ clicked on the United States, you can see the following:

Now, because A ðŸ”´ owns the United States, he can attack with that country. This means, that, after he clicked on the USA, he can click on any neighboring country (or a country with a black line connecting the United States, e.g. the United Kingdom), leading to the following screen:

![AAD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65167682/228306005-a8f1d42a-dd00-416d-a0e0-354217695148.png)

Now, if A ðŸ”´ clicks on the "Attack!" button, an attack is initated.
But how do we determine, if the attack is succesful? Here, the real-world data comes into play. 
On the upper part of the screen you can see the following:

![AAE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65167682/228307041-a951801f-eb54-49a1-a56b-9e245b50157e.png)


Every turn a new attribute is randomly chosen. In this case, it is "number of urban areas with more than 1 mio. citizens". This attribute determines, whether you are succesful with your attack. For example, after A ðŸ”´ starts the attack, he would see the following:

![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65167682/228307642-34a3dd19-6da7-4480-83be-0de1ca263611.png)

You can get the following informations from this window:
The United States has 43 urban areas with more than 1 mio. citizens, while Canada has 6.

Because the United States has more, A ðŸ”´'s attack is succesful and Canada now belongs to  A ðŸ”´. 

 A ðŸ”´ can click now on the "success" button to close the window and give the turn to B ðŸ”µ.
